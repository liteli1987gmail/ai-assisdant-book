In the distance, they could hear the gentle lowing of cows and the playful bleating of lambs. The children made their way to the barn, where they helped feed the animals. They giggled as they watched the baby chicks pecking at their food and the piglets rolling in the mud.

After their chores were done, the children gathered by the old oak tree, their imaginations running wild. They built forts out of hay bales and played hide-and-seek among the tall cornstalks. Their laughter echoed through the farm, a joyful symphony of innocence and happiness.
