Transcript:
(0:00) foreign [Music] it's been called the Harvard of Silicon Valley Y combinator is perhaps the most prestigious startup incubator in the world it's funded more than 700 companies to date including Dropbox Airbnb and stripe but behind the startup machine is a couple with their own startup Story how did they build Y combinator into what it is today joining me today on this edition of Studio 1.
(0:35) 0 why combinator Founders and husband wife Paul Graham and Jessica Livingston thank you so much for joining us thank you great to have you so Paul it's been what like six months since you stepped down from the helm about that yeah of why combinator how's it going oh it's so great I wish had done it two years before why it was so hard Running Y combinator I mean I'm not really an administrator and YC had gotten kind of big suddenly I was running this big thing and I was never suited to it you said you would bring
(1:10) back did you get your brain back yes you're still doing office hours I had this afternoon I had the best conversation with the founder that I have ever had I lunch with Patrick Collison found her stripe 100 of the conversation was about giant take over the world ambitious plans and that is like the best possible office hours how involved are you guys I'm still very much involved I'm doing all the same things that I used to do if if not engaged in different things I miss working with Paul but I also love working with Sam Altman now was
(1:43) actually the founder of one your very first companies yeah looped when you stepped down there were certainly people out there who said he's not cut out to be you it's a good thing he's not cut out to be me because I was not cut out to run something as big as Y combinator is now he better than me at this come on I was good giving advice to Founders is Sam gonna be better than PG well they're going to be different um Sam brings a lot of things to the table that neither of us had which is just this amazing amount of energy
(2:13) and patience that's needed to broker deals with investors why combinator is doing a lot of different things as result I want to talk a little bit about each of you and where came from where you grew up your parents my family came here from England when I was three and a half and we lived in Pittsburgh because my father worked in the nuclear business when you designed a nuclear reactor he was the one who would figure out if it was going to explode so what kind of kid were you I was a bad half the kids in my neighborhood were
(2:43) forbidden to play with me what did you do I was just always getting in trouble with everybody just constantly I was suspended from school I think at least once every year from like first grade to to 12th grade and then at a certain point you got into computers did that help they really didn't teach people computers in school it was something you did over you did off on the side so when did you start coding uh I think when was 15 on an IBM 1401 with 12K of magnetic core memory and then you went on to Harvard get your PhD yeah in
(3:21) computer science but you also took art classes on the side it was a very disorganized trajectory I never knew what I was trying to do and it always a mess of like random accidents Jessica what about you well I grew up outside of Boston and I was an angel um I grew up with my father and grandmother his mother had a very happy childhood and Friends wanted to play with me I knew I like to write but had no idea what I wanted to be or what do I know ultimately you ended up at a boutique Investment Bank were you technical did you ever learn how to code
(4:00) I never learned to code and I'm not technical in the least someday when I retire from my combinator I'm going to learn to code but I was interested in it now Paul before y commentator you started another company tell me about via web the idea at the time was quite revolutionary well the reason company was called via web is that the software worked via the web right it was what is now known as a web app um and it was the first one was an online store Builder got bought by Yahoo and eventually became still is Yahoo's tour what was it like working at
(4:36) Yahoo how long did you last there the guy who got suspended every year I was basically getting suspended from Yahoo too I hereby apologize to all the people I have ever worked for so I like barely lasted a year and you went on to write you started writing essays at paulgram.com yeah and that's when you started building your following I suppose so I didn't really think was building what were you writing about I started just writing about software then I gradually realized that no one would come and drag me away if I started
(5:05) writing about other things too at what point did you guys meet we met at a party Paul's house in Cambridge that I almost didn't attend so my combinator almost didn't exist it always didn't exist it's scary how close it was yes how did you come up with the idea for a y combinator well Jessica was was very interested in startups she was writing a book that was the I read when I moved to Silicon Valley really you're never tired of hearing stories like that it was really hard to find any information on startups and I was so
(5:40) fascinated by all the stories that I heard from these guys and then you gave the talk at Harvard yeah about that became the essay how to start a startup one of the things I told them was that they should raise money from people who had gotten the money from starting a startup because then they could get advice they were all looking at me expectantly like baby birds looking at their mother wanting to feed them but then afterwards I felt sort of bad because I had always thought was going to do some Angel investment I still
(6:10) hadn't gotten around to it because I didn't know how I thought all right I'll do it I'll do finally start doing some Angel Investing it was not supposed to grow into this big thing this is one of the things we tell Founders so often the best way to start a startup that's really going to take over the world is don't even try to start a startup just try and start project that you think would be cool to work on and YC was an instance of this how did you come up with the name y combinator the original name was Cambridge seed yeah but then we thought
(6:40) I mean it's a cool name we were in Cambridge but it was too tied to one place the Y combinator is a trick Lambda calculus which is a formal language for expressing algorithms it's a math a concept basically how did you guys decide to work together on this because you weren't married yet but that's a big decision it was very that was it scary because we had only been dating for a year [Music] [Music] there are myths about so many of the Great companies startups Founders that are boiled down into Legend and what is
(7:23) the myth of Y combinator and what is the reality people just do not realize how like not interested we were in making money I'm thinking of all these people saying on forums oh it's so self-serving but honestly in the beginning we were not trying to make money it was all an experiment to see if these like new ideas could work a lot of people think it as Paul Graham's y combinator oh there's a myth there's a really big you've called Jessica the secret weapon like nothing has ever happened a y combinator that Jessica did not like set her seal
(8:00) of approval on right there is she basically has veto over everything and this is the first time that you guys have been interviewed together yeah I can't believe that well let's face it I'm not as interesting you I don't make colorful remarks and I've chosen to be behind the scenes I'm more comfortable behind the scenes I like running things this is why she the secret weapon she is one of these people who has Perfect Pitch for character she can talk to somebody and fairly quickly tell whether they're a good person or not so tell me about the first
(8:33) class eight companies but you didn't know if anyone was gonna even apply right right we we had no idea if people were going to apply and we had like a few hundred applications the most critical Innovation with the YC model is to fund a bunch of startups at once so it's better for the investor but also better for the startups because they have colleagues that is the big thing you're missing in a startup it's so lonely and now it's like it has some of the advantages being part of a company without the disadvantages at what point
(9:03) did you decide to take money from investors because obviously you had when we had things about VCS no we to frankly I ran out of money and it takes I mean how long does it take we don't even know yet how long it takes for the big exits but like 10 years maybe you're going into your 19th funding cycle mm-hmm what do you consider the most successful YC companies it is pretty much the ones with the high valuations three with the highest valuations or Airbnb Dropbox and Stripes did you know early on that there were going to be hits
(9:38) we knew the founders were good what was it about Drew house did and Brian chesky what was it about them that different things yeah it was different things about the two of them in Drew's case he was the guy who could write this software Dropbox succeeded by solving an almost impossibly hard problem whereas Airbnb is different Airbnb like this mass movement where everyone's staying in other people's houses worldwide we were skeptical though I just remember thinking I don't really care what the idea is these Founders are awesome we're
(10:12) funding them Patrick Collison from stripe I have known since he was like 14. back when he was this high school kid in Ireland he used to email me questions about the lisp programming language and I had no idea he was a kid now that these companies are worth multi-billions of dollars when you look back if they had the opportunity would they have sold almost everyone if someone came along with a big enough offer at the right moment would have taken it we do know with Drew actually because in the Y combinator application
(10:41) early on we used to ask if someone came along offered you money for your company right after YC what's the least you would take I think Drew answered a million dollars so it's really convenient for everyone involved that no one wanted to buy Dropbox early on now that you've been doing this for so many years can you identify the future Drew Houston's and Brian chesky's the future drop boxes and airbnbs earlier sooner than everybody else we might be able to identify them better than other people but there are limits to how well
(11:15) you can identify them there's a good deal of luck if you had to boil it down into one word what you're looking for it's authentic you're looking for people who are real friends not just people who got together for purposes of this startup you don't want people who are just in it for the money zuck's not it for the money he never was and that was why he turned down the Yahoo acquisition offer and without having done that he would never Facebook wouldn't be what it is today how has the interview process evolved we first
(11:42) started out was it 40 minutes I think was 40 minute interviews and now with the 10-minute interviews we really don't have like a pitch how can you really know in 10 minutes you can't know for sure here's an interesting test after each minute How likely are you to change your mind if you had another 10 minutes you might only change your mind two percent of the time what is the average valuation of all the YC companies I know uh what their valuation is it just crossed 30 billion what's your stake in the all the money is in few big hits
(12:15) right and so you have to ask what percentage do you end up with a few big hits after dilution and we assume it'll end up being like three percent something like that so three percent of thirty see I've literally never done this calculation 900 million but until you asked me that I had never actually multiplied those numbers together an article was written recently that Sequoia has made more money on y combinator than y combinator has yeah strictly speaking I believe more of that 30 billion dollars worth of equity
(12:47) belongs to Sequoia than us and your policy is that you don't make follow-on investments right would you ever consider changing that policy in order to make money off the hits that you picked we never say but the problem with that Emily is there's a signaling thing right um and so if we're to do follow-on Investments we're telling other investors who we believe are going to be the best and that would hurt the founders who are probably great investment opportunities but we just didn't choose to do a follow-on in does it bother you that
(13:17) Sequoia has made more money than you have no who cares I'm happy for them I really like Sequoia why combinator has gotten so much praise but also a lot of criticism why do you think it's so controversial one of the most surprising things I realized as why combinator became more successful is that the famous Something becomes the more people want to attack it it's always been a mystery to me though because honestly every night I go to sleep think you know did we help the founders today and the answer is almost always Yes actually
(13:50) she goes to bed at night and she says what is everyone's saying all these mean things about us that's so not true you've said that other investors have tried to stab you in the back do you think they're are they jealous there have been some things that you just can't believe someone's going to do that to you um I don't know why they mean it's probably boils down to money and power I don't know one thing that people have said to me is that well YC has invested in over 700 companies there's only a handful of hits is that a good track
(14:21) record you either have a couple hits or no hits those are the only two options right so yes ryc companies overvalued maybe maybe all startups are and so I've heard investors claiming that startup the YC startups at demo day are like 2X overvalued and that is the greatest compliment that means we can take people into YC and even if we did nothing else they would be able to get twice the valuation they would have otherwise but is that a good thing if the company is not really worth that if it's a lot then it was a bargain anyway even if
(14:55) it was overpriced now something else that you've been in I know this is something that Jessica has thought a lot about is not admitting enough women that true we don't have enough women applying which is what we're really making an effort now on incur trying to do we we don't ask on the application what someone's gender is we're trying to get the word out there that more women should be starting startups we've hosted a female Founders conference that we're going to do again this winter where we bring you know successful female
(15:29) Founders and tell their stories to inspire more women some of the words people use are harsh I mean they've called y combinator a frat house how many women have you funded in the past it was usually around four percent of the founders in batches were female and now it's more like 12 and obviously that's not where we ideally want to be but it's moving in the right direction how do we get more women founding women who are Larry and Sergey examples are what makes everyone want to start startups how have you changed the interview process in subtle
(16:05) ways to make sure you are getting the best people that you're not discriminating that everyone has an equal shot well one thing that's changed recently is that we have a female partner in every one of the interview rooms why not completely blind screen everyone can you tell if they were telling the truth then I couldn't observe their interaction [Music] you've got two kids what kind of parents are you Paul is the best father I've ever met I I'm going to say that because you wouldn't say that yourself he spends so
(16:50) much time with them teaching things exposing them to things that I've rarely seen a lot of other fathers do so I lucked out now how do you manage being married and being colleagues it always worked really well it was really easy we never disagreed on anything really I think have you ever thought about y combinator think so no um I don't believe it it's really true it's really true and the secret is same secret that's true for co-founders in general which is you have different responsibilities right each person is in
(17:26) charge of their own thing and they're experts in that thing what is the hottest why combinator company that we don't know about yet  boosted boards why let's just say they have bigger Ambitions than making skateboards what is the biggest fire you've had to put out a startup I put fires at least one a week of co-founder disputes that and fundraising interactions with investors and investors maltreating the startups we intervene but can you think how do you intervene like how protect a startup from its own investors at this
(18:08) point you don't have to like make explicit threats right you just sort of say come on guys be nice um but the investors know that behind the come on guys be nice is if you don't we won't send any more startups to you and if you don't all of the Y combinator Founders will know about it like the next day the next biggest regret it's a bit Grim but um it's very easy for me to say now what my biggest mistake is I can answer I'll do my my biggest regret is I kind of squandered my college education I didn't learn as many things I could learn or
(18:54) work as hard I could have and always you know compare myself to the founders we fund who are doing so many um interesting and ambitious things I think I kind of like squandered a little bit of my youth Paul um I have to say it very carefully so can remain in control of myself but um remind your parents to be screened for colon cancer I understand my father passed away there are many things that I would like to tell him yeah and do for colon cancer man it's just if they catch it early it's so preventable you know gotta remind me
(19:36) to make him go get screened so what is next I mean YC or will there be a second for call act from Paul and Jessica I am like fully just as enthusiastic about why combinator as I was the day we got started if not more so we're doing many exciting things it actually seems like a good idea how about you Paul I'm going to go back writing that's what I was doing before Y combinator and that's what I always was hoping to do how do you guys want YC to be remembered you know I don't want YC to be remembered I want it to still exist
(20:18) right I want YC to be like this institution that persists for a long time it could last a lot longer than com than a product company does because structurally it's more like a university it could in principle last for hundreds of years I wanted to be remembered as changing a lot of people's lives um and hopefully making the world a little bit of a better place Paul Graham and Jessica Livingston thank you so much thank you thank for doing this and being our guests on Studio 1.
(20:47) 0 [Music] thank you
